# WarTracker
A very simple mod that allows you to track wars and post to an API

# How to use
- Host a POST api that takes this data and stores it locally (will be making one soon)
- modify the config (.minecraft/config/phoenix/wartracker.yml) with the content
     url=YourAPIUrlHere
- Put the mod in your mod folder
- Wars should be tracked now
